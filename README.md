In a 6G network environment, proactive mobility management is essential as 6G mobile networks provide new services with ultra-low latency through the dense deployment of small cells. The importance of a system that actively controls device handover is emerging and it is essential to predict mobile trajectory during handover. Sequence-to-sequence model is a kind of deep learning model where it converts sequences from one domain to sequences in another domain, and is mainly used in natural language processing. Here, we developed a system for processing the data needed for predicting mobile trajectory in a wireless network environment that can be utilized by sequence-to-sequence model.
